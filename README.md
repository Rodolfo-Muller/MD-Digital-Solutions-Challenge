# How to start the project R3 and R4:

If you want to see the page for yourself, you'll need to do the following:

- Clone the repository
- npm install:

```
ANGULAR_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4200
```

- Install [Mongoodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) on your computer and create a database called `DB`.

```
DATABASE_Mongo=mongodb+srv:/mongodb://localhost:27017/DB


The app doesn't have any products or users created by default, you'll have to add them yourself! In order to do so, you'll have to log in as an admin. The default admin is:

```
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: admin
```
